const portfolioDesc = 'I deliberated whether or not to show my previous attempt at a portfolio for a while, but then I thought, "well, it definitely shows progress!". This was built with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, with animation handled by a few native jQuery methods. If you look, you can see my tic tac toe project I listed just above this! It was also an attempt to host somewhere other than heroku, for no other purpose than varitey.  This one wound up on github pages.'
